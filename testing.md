Testing this site was conducted using various methods to identify any bugs throughout the site.

## W3C Validators

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the code on all of the pages and to make sure that there were no syntax errors in the project. Both the HTML and CSS code was run through these services regualarly during the building of this project to ensure the code was valid throughout the process and to avoid nasty suprises at the end. 

* [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## DevTools

Google Chrome DevTools was used for rigorous testing of the site. It was used for various different reasons.
    
* It tested for the responsiveness of the site across multiple screen resolutions.
    * It revealed an issue with the social links and navbar links. Media queries were added to control and ensure size and placement on different screen sizes. 
    * The Bootstrap grid system was updated and implemented more often to control how the columns responded.
    * Containers were discovered to be of good use to keep structure flowing.
* Debugging
    * Highlighted incorrect use of styling and/or Bootstrap.

## Site Testing 

### User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

* First Time Visitor Goals:
    * As a first visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the entire site, comfortably and securely.
        * When the site is first loaded, a navbar is presented clearly and is easily readable. Users are made to feel comfortable with the simplicity of the site. 
        * A hero image underneath contains overlaying text of a welcoming and informative manner. There is also a call to action button to join the gym now. 
        * Content hinting gives incentive to scroll down.
        * The user is also invited through the navbar to click between pages. The navbar remains present on all pages, so the security of knowing you can go anywhere at anytime is there.

    * As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily message the gym with any initial queires that I may have.
        * At first sight of the home page, a navbar clearly indicates the option to 'Contact'.
        * Upon clicking 'Contact', the user is presented with a minimal form to keep the process clear and simple.
        * The form encourages the user with a heading and asks for their name, email and message, follwed by a clear 'Submit' button.

    * As a first-time visitor, I want to learn more about the gym and what is available.
        * After arriving at the easy-to-read home page, the navbar presents two clear options: 'Classes' and 'About'. Content hinting is also found on the home page where the user can scroll down, read testimonials, and reveals an image displaying the text 'Coming Soon'.
        * Upon navigating to other pages, the user can read - alongside an image - what classes are available and what to expect. They can also read (in a vertical manner presented in cards) a flowing story of the origins of Soul Gym and its mission for the future.

* Prospective Gym Member:
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to know how much membership costs.
        * When the user first loads the site, overlaying the eye-catching hero image, text clearly displays the cost of a membership at Â£30 per month.
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to be able to book a tour.
        * At the bottom of each page, in the footer, a user can clearly read 'Want to see more? Book a tour here' with a calender icon that is clickable.
        * Using this link directs the user to the contact page where they can fill out the form and enquire about booking a tour. They are also reminded that they can book a tour in the heading for the contact form.
        * The user is expected to fill out this basic form to request a tour.
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to see what classes and facilities the gym offers.
        * The user from the home page is invited to scroll down the page, which reveals an image informing them that a spa is coming soon.
        * Having navigated to the 'Classes' page using the clear navbar, the user can see what classes are available and what they all offer.
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to feel comfortable and informed that this gym is right for me.
        * The entire site is created to provide a welcoming and calming feeling. The user can navigate to the 'About' page, where they can read the inspiring story of the owner's journey to starting Soul Gym.
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to be able to contact and locate the gym.
        * As written above, once the user has used the navigation to the 'Contact' page, a form is presented to contact the gym. Content hinting is also used here to have the user scroll to reveal the gym's contact details, along with an interactive map.
    * As a prospective gym member, I want to be able to sign up to the gym.
        * Using the clear and tidy navbar, the user can follow it to the 'Register' page, where a form is offered to be filled out.
        * Users must create a username, provide an email address, and create a password. They will also have to confirm this password for added security.
        * The user cannot submit the registration form until it is filled out correctly.
        * The user is then redirected to a 'Thank You' page and a button to return them to the 'Home' page. The navbar is also still of use on this page.

* As a member of Soul Gym:
    * As a member of Soul Gym, I want to be able to login to my account with the gym.
        * The user is clearly invited through the use of the navbar to head over to the 'Login' page.
        * Here, a basic form is presented asking for a username/email address and password.
    * As a member of Soul Gym, I want to be able to book a class.
        * Once the user knows what class they would like to book, they have two options which will lead to the same outcome. 
        * At the top of the 'classes' page, the user can clearly see a call to action button reading 'Book Now'.
        The navigation bar can also be used to access the contact page. The user then has to fill out the form simply stating name email and message, i.e. what class and what time slot they'd like to book. 
    * As a member of Soul Gym, I want to be kept up to date on any new facilities and initiatives the gym is working towards.
        * When following the invitation to scroll down the 'Home' page, a large image presents information that a spa is coming soon. This section will be used to display any new information of up and coming events.
    * As a member of Soul Gym, I want to be able to easily access a weekly class timetable, so I can plan my visits.
        * The user can use the navbar to access the 'Classes' page from any other page. Content hinting is used to provoke the user to scroll down. Once they do they are presented with the timetable of classes.
    * As a member of Soul Gym, I want to be able to submit any questions, feedback or complaints.
        * The navbar clearly presents the 'Contact' page. A form is first seen after the heading of 'Got a question'. The user can use this form to submit a query, complaint or feedbak they like.

### User Testing

Once my project was nearly finsihed, minus the odd bug issue, I sent it out to be reviewed.

#### Peer-code-review

My project was submitted to the peer-code-review channel page of the Slack community for Code Institute. The overall reviews were positive, providing compliments of the dynamic and fluid structure to the scrolling image of the homepage and the clean and tidy spacing of the elements of the page.

I was advised to check if Bootstrap's 'container-fluid' property was neccesary over just a 'container'. I implemented these changes where necessary, e.g.: the footer section. 

#### User Review

My project was also sent out to various friends and family members to review the site thouroughly and read through the supporting documentation. I received feedback from people of different ages and professions and they notifyied me of any bugs and/or user experience issues. The general reviews of my page were positive, commenting on the inviting colours and appealing imagery. The structure was complemented along with the ease of navigation, and the site's uncluttered design.

### Further Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari browsers. It was viewed on a range of different devices, such as desktop, laptops, iPhone 5S, iPhone 8 plus, iPhoneX, iPad 2019, and Samsung Galaxy. Extensive testing was carried out to make sure the links were working correctly, and that the images are loading correctly.
