## **What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?**
This is my first milestone project where I have designed, created and built a mobile-first responsive website for a gym. My goals with this website are to share the unique perspective on fitness that this gym offers; to persuade prospective members to sign up; and to give existing members an online space to book classes and enforce a sense of community. 

I have taken my knowledge learnt from the beginning three modules of the Full Stack Web Developer course, (HTML, CSS Fundamentals, and User Centric Frontend Development Modules) to provide a clear, functioning and responsive website that demonstrates a proficient use of HTML5 and CSS3. The Bootstrap Framework was used along side these programming languages to help give the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site is as responsive as possible for use across various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Design
##### 1. Colour Scheme

I chose soothing, neutral colours to make the website inviting and help visitors feel calm when visiting the site. The muted tones give the page a serene look and feel. This was important to me as my aim was to create an online space that promotes mental as well as physical health and wellbeing. 

Colours I used are:

* ECEAEA - Platinum - Primary Colour
* C4A55F - Light French Beige - Secondary Colour
* 827081 - Old Lavender - Accent Colour
* 000000 - Black - Text Colour

The primary colour, Platinum (ECEAEA), was used throughout the pages to give the whole site consistency. I used it for the navbar and footer, as well as the background colour for my forms and individual cards on both the 'Classses' and 'About' pages.<br>
I originally used the secondary colour, Light French Beige (C4A55F), within the symbol in my logo. When I included this in the page, I found it provided a nice contrast with the primary colour. This led me to use it throughout the site for social icons, buttons, table hover and the names of the people in the quotes section.<br>
I knew I needed another accent colour to make the site more engaging. I went for Old Lavender (827081) which both contrasted with the primary colour and complemented the secondary colour. I used it to implement user feedback. When a user hovers over the social icons and clicks they go from Light French Beige to Old Lavender. To cement the accent colour's presence on the site and make the scheme feel more cohesive, I also used it for block dividers between content and as borders for the forms and cards. I feel this really helped to make the content within the cards stand out.<br>
I toyed with the idea to have a fourth colour as a main background across the pages, but I found that it made them look too busy and muddied the design. The main goal of this gym is to change the way people see fitness with an emphasis on yoga, meditation and mindfulness. With this in mind, I thought it was better to keep a degree of white space throughout the site. It made it easier on the eye and promoted the minimalist, serene look and feel I was aiming for.<br>
I opted for Black (00000) as my text colour to make sure all the words clear and easy to read. The only pieces of text I did not implement this colour on were the names of people I quoted on the home page (detailed above) as I felt these would benefit from a bit of contrast.

##### 2. Font

I decided to use two fonts throught my site. I included these fonts by inserting an _import_ link of Google Fonts API into the top of my style.css.<br>
The font I chose for the body text on the pages was 'Roboto', with a fall back of 'Sans-serif' should the site not load the import correctly. I found the 'Roboto' font was clear and easy to read and fed into the simple, minimal look and feel I was trying to achieve with the site.<br>
The second font I used was 'Noto Sans', again with the fallback of 'Sans-serif'. I used this for anything I wanted to stand out a little more. This included the navbar, footer, headlines and sub-headings. I wanted a font that complemented the body text without being wildly different from it. This would have made the page too busy and drawn attention away from the beautiful, peace-invoking imagery it was sitting alongside. Simplicity was key and the combination of Roboto and Noto Sans helped me achieve that objective.

##### 3. Logo

The logo was created using an online design tool called Canva. I created a custom canvas to fit my required dimensions and set the background to the primary colour so it blended with the navbar.
When it came to designing the logo I wanted a symbol that matched the look and feel of the site. I selectedthe mandala from Canva's selection of free symbols and played with the colours until I found a combination I liked. This is where I found what would become the secondary colour of my entire website.
I chose the font 'Chakra Petch' for the logo because it felt modern and stood out with its angular edges without being too bold. It suited the site's branding and complemented all my other design choices well. 

##### 4. Composition

There is a clear structure throughout the site. Each of the main pages was has a hero image at the top to engage the user with text overtop of it. I also implemented content hinting where possible to encourage scrolling and more user interaction. 
To help me keep the design neat and consistent, I used the 'Rule of Thirds'. This also helps to draw the viewer's eye into the composition, rather than just glancing at the center, so I wanted to make sure I implemented it in my design. You can find evidence of this in the footer, but it's displayed most clearly on the 'Classes' page with the cards and the 'Home' page with the quotes. 
I was going to display the 'About' page in this way, but upon consideration I decided to place the cards down the centre. Because of the volume of text in these cards, they made the page too cluttered when they were in a row of three. Displaying them crentally down the page kept a good amount of white space. I also think that having to scroll down through the cards made it feel like the story was unfolding which I thought was a nice touch.

##### 5. Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq. I initially sketched rough ideas down on paper and then further constructed them on the computer using Balsamiq to create a more detailed mockup. The final pages I ended up with on the website did not vary too much from the wireframes I made during the planning stages. Find the links to these wireframes below:

## **Features**

#### Existing Features

* Navbar - Featured across all pages, site visitors can use the links on the right to navigate between all pages on the website. These links also collapse down into a hamburger icon at smaller screen sizes. The logo, found on the left, can be clicked on all pages to take users back to the home page.

* Footer - Also featured across all pages, the footer is used for imforming the user that they can book a tour and provides a link in the form of an icon to the contact page where said tour can be scheduled. This is found on the left third of the footeer. On the right third of the footer, users will find social icons linking to the coresponding social media pages.

* Hero images -  These can be found across the three main pages (Home, Classes and About), and provide a visual reference to the page the user is on. There is also text displayed on top of the image, relating to the page, as well as a call to action button linking to desired pages - e.g.: Register page from the Home and About pages, and Contact page from the Classes page. These interavtive features encourage the user to register with the gym and book a class. There is also a hero image used on the homepage at the bottom to advertise that there will soon be a spa available at the gym. This is to ensure the user that the gym is still an expanding facility, forever moving forward.

* Testimonials - The 'Why Choose Us' section was created to showcase what other customers thought of the gym and what it has to offer.

* Classes Page - This page showcases what classes are available, informing the user what to expect from each class. It also contains a timetable that the user can use to decide what classes they can take on a particular day and time.

* About Page - This page was created to help the user understand how the gym came about. The gym promotes mental wellbeing and mindfulness which are incredibly personal facets of fitness. I wanted to appeal to readers by giving the gym a personal touch and providing the reader with an origin story that shows how the gym came about. 
I felt this added a personal touch and acknowledging the cultural origins of Soul Gym's practice gave the whole brand and platform more integrity.
I've also included a section which details Soul Gym's mission for the future. This is used to incentivise prospective members to sign up. It also enforces a sense of community for existing users and gives them a reason to revisit the site and check on the gym's projects progress 

* Contact Page - This page provides a form users can fill out to contact the gym. They can use this to book classes, schedul a tour and submit any other general enquiries. The user can also find the contact details of the gym below with an interactive map that can be clicked on and viewed on a larger scale on Google Maps in a seperate tab.

* Forms - Forms were used on the 'Login' and 'Register' pages. The user is invited to sign up to the gym by filling out the form or, alternatively, to sign into their existing account.

* 'Join Now' button on Registration Form - Once the user has completed the registration form and clicks 'Join Now', they are redirected to an internal page providing them with feedback that the registration has gone through successfully. It is important to provide feedback to the user so they feel their actions have been validated.

#### Future Features

* Gallery Page - A seperate page to showcase images of the gym's classes and interactions with their customers. This would give the user a more concrete idea of how the gym operates through using friendly and fun images.

* Donate Page / Modal - As described in the story on the about page, the gym donates 20% of its earnings to help towards community projects across Asia. A page where members and/or non-members can help contribute towards these initiatives will boost engagement with the gym and help the gym achieve its charitable goals.

* A more defined view of membership costs by perhaps creating a membership page containg the different packages on offer.

* Create a profile builder where the user fills in some questions, and then are show suggested profiles for them personally, highlighting timeslots that would work for them.
